# Surprise-Me

Welcome to my SurpriseMe app. The app will ask you a number of questions, then will spit back a list of restaurants that match that criteria. The site was built with Flask/Jinja, HTML, and CSS while the program itself was created with the web-scraping libraries Selenium and Beautiful Soup + JSON & request modules. I also configured the site's hosting vis-a-vis Google Cloud and its Linux based CLI.
